# ENT-Block
This is a short code in python. I am not responsible for what you do with it.


To use it correctly, put it in a .py file, be careful that you have defined the correct url in the code, you just have to replace the already existing url with the connection page of your ENT. It may be that the program does not work especially if you have to use a captch or if the site is a minimum secure. Do not use it improperly. When you run the code, it will ask you for an identifier to enter, and then you will enter a number which will be the maximum number of characters that the password can contain (this parameter is not important). Once you run enter, the program will try lots of different passwords and if your ENT has security, the session will be blocked.
